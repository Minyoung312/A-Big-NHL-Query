  <u><h2>Introduction</h2></u>
  <p>   Before the NHL introduced a salary cap after the 2004-2005 lockout,
      many teams making the highest revenue in the league would acquire the best players because they could afford to pay them much more than any team could. This obviously impacted the lower revenue making teams in the league in a big way, as they could not afford to acquire these great players, so they would end up not winning many games and not making the playoffs, further lowering their revenue.
      When the NHL introduced a salary cap for the 2005-2006 season, teams had to start strategizing the best way they could spend their cap, whether it was investing to improve their forwards, improving their defense, or an equal mix of both.
      Even though years have passed since the salary cap was introduced to the league, there are still teams in the NHL who believe that spending most of their cap acquiring a few amazing stars to their team will lead them to success. But is this method really the best way to become league champions?
      The purpose of this project is to show whether or not this method is the most effective way to lead a team to a championship. To experiment this thought, this project will first research the top 25 highest salaries from the year 1991 to 2004, which was before the salary cap was implemented, then the top 25 highest salaries from the years after the salary cap was implemented, from the year 2006 to 2020, and then compare both data to see how many of these players made it past every round of the playoffs, compared to the other.


</p>

  <u><h2>Procedure</h2></u>
  <p><ul>
      <li>Look up the top 25 highest paid players in the NHL, from 1991 to 2020 </li>
      <li>Look up the playoff bracket of every season, from 1991 to 2020</li>
      <li>Determine in each season how many teams with one of the top 25 highest paid players, made it past the first round of the playoffs, make two separate graphs from 1991 to 2004, and 2006 to 2020 showing these results, and determine the mean, median, and mode of these data </li>
      <li>Determine in each season how many teams with one of the top 25 highest paid players, made it past the second round of the playoffs, make two separate graphs from 1991 to 2004, and 2006 to 2020 showing these results, and determine the mean, median, and mode of these data</li>
      <li>Determine in each season how many teams, with one of the top 25 highest paid players, made it past the third round of the playoffs, make two separate graphs from 1991 to 2004, and 2006 to 2020 showing these results, and determine the mean, median, and mode of these data</li>
      <li>Determine in each season how many teams, with one of the top 25 highest paid players, won the Stanley Cup, make two separate graphs from 1991 to 2004, and 2006 to 2020 showing these results, and determine the mean, median, and mode of these data</li>


  </ul> </p>

  <u><h2>Methods of Sampling</h2></u>
  <p> The method of sampling will be a systematic sampling method, where a different player will be chosen every one interval down, starting from the highest paid player. *Note that in the 2004-2005 season there was a lockout, so there will be no data regarding that year. Also note that in some seasons the commissioner is included
      in the data, but he will be excluded.</p>
