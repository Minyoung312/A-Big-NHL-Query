   <u><h2><p style="text-align:center;">Conclusion</h2></u><br>

    <p> When looking at the graphs for both the seasons before and after the salary cap, the results show that teams spending a big chunk of their cap on acquiring superstar players is still an effective way of winning a championship.
        Although the graphs showing the highest paid players who passed the first round are quite different compared to each other (on average about 3 more players made it past the first round of the playoffs, before the salary cap), after this round the comparisons between both sets of data are very similar to each other. The results of this research has shown that the method teams use to spend a big chunk of their cap on acquiring the best players, does not make a big difference in regards to winning a championship. </p>


  <br> <u><h2><p style="text-align:center;">Evaluation of Techniques</h2></u><br>

    <p>If this research were to take a look at the top 25 highest paid players from every season the league was around starting from 1917, it would take far too long. If we were to look at every single season, the graphs before the salary cap would have massive differences because there were seasons where there were not as many teams in the league.
        For example in the Original Six era, there were only six teams who competed in the league, so many of the top 25 highest paid players would be on one team, therefore many more players would have made it past each round. </p><br>
